* Running the simulation for the minimum number of resources:
-> 1 Staff is able to register up to 
1*12(per hour)*8(hours)=96 visitors during the simulation. 
-> 2 Health Workers are able to vaccinate up to 
2*6(per hour)*8(hours)=96 visitors during the simulation. 
-> 6 Waiting Rooms can be occupied by up to 
6*2(per hour)*8(hours)=96 visitors during the simulation.

-> Final State at 15:55:00 PM.

* Running the simulation for a realistic scenario of available resources:
-> 7 Staff is able to register up to 
7*12(per hour)*8(hours)=768 visitors during the simulation. 
-> 14 Health Workers are able to vaccinate up to 
14*6(per hour)*8(hours)=768 visitors during the simulation. 
-> 42 Waiting Rooms can be occupied by up to 
42*2(per hour)*8(hours)=768 visitors during the simulation.
